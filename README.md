# The Inspiration
This project analyzes Shopify and Facebook Ads data.
Initially, this project was done to see how effective Facebook Ads are. Since Facebook is a social media platform where users focus on interacting with each other, it's hard to see how Facebook Ads can normally perform well. 
Some arguments that lead me to believe that Facebook Ads would not perform well are:
<ul>
  <li>It's a platform where users are usually not focused on making purchases</li>
  <li>Content creators need to pay for more publicity on their posts, making publicity weighted more closely to the cost paid for the publicity/ad versus quality of the content/ad</li>
  
  <!--<li> </li>-->
  
</ul>

However, one can argue that maybe the main strategy for companies that want to promote their products on Facebook is to reach as wide of an audience as possible. Maybe products can be tailored to certain audiences who share an interest and will therefore perform better than we would expect.

If this is the case, then how can we measure how successful a Facebook Ad is? Through the number of people the ad reaches out to? Through the number of people who end up actually making purchases?

These questions are explored through this project.
<!-- talk about users/creators/advertisors and their interests -->
