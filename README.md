# The Inspiration
This project analyzes Shopify and Facebook Ads data.
Initially, this project was done to see how effective Facebook Ads are. Since Facebook is a social media platform where users focus on interacting with each other, it's hard to see how Facebook Ads can normally perform well. 
Some arguments that lead me to believe that Facebook Ads would not perform well are:
<ul>
  <li>It's a platform where users are usually not focused on making purchases</li>
  <li>Content creators need to pay for more publicity on their posts, making publicity weighted more closely to the cost paid for the publicity/ad versus quality of the content/ad</li>
  
  <!--<li> </li>-->
  
</ul>

However, one can argue that maybe the main strategy for companies that want to promote their products on Facebook is to reach as wide of an audience as possible. Maybe products can be tailored to certain audiences who share an interest and will therefore perform better than we would expect.

If this is the case, then how can we measure how successful a Facebook Ad is? Through the number of people the ad reaches out to? Through the number of people who end up actually making purchases?

These questions are explored through this project.
<!-- talk about users/creators/advertisors and their interests -->

# Measuring Performance
Since the purpose of ads is the make sales, we can use the number of sales that the ad resulted in to gauge how well the ad did. However, this metric would make us prefer many small sales to few big sales, even if the few big sales resulted in more revenue. One way to solve this is to measure performance by using the revenue that the ad made due to its sales. This gives us more information in the form of dollars and also allows us to start thinking of ways to use the cost of the ad to measure how it's doing. Since we want to have higher revenue and lower costs for an ad, we can use a metric that divides the revenue of the ad by the cost of the ad. This incentivizes higher revenue and penalizes higher cost. This metric is called Return On Ad Spend (ROAS).
