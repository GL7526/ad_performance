This project analyzes Shopify and Facebook Ads data.
Initially, this project was done to see how effective Facebook Ads are. Since Facebook is a social media platform where users focus on interacting with each other, it's hard to see how Facebook Ads can normally perform well. However, one can argue that maybe the main strategy for companies that want to promote their products on Facebook is to reach as wide of an audience as possible. Maybe products can be tailored to certain audiences who share an interest and will therefore perform better than we would expect.
